						<!-- Use Ptags to write observations and conclusion -->
						<br>
						<p>
							&nbsp; Divorce and depression rates have a correlation of about 0.53.
							Given that divorcees are generally unhappy over their breakup, this makes sense.
							However, the data does not show which factor precedes the other (i.e. depression > divorce).
						</p>
						<p>
							&nbsp; Poverty and the rate of heart attacks have a generally weak correlation (0.37).
							Poor diets and low exercise can lead to more heart attacks and the stress associated with Poverty 
							may lead to elevated risk of a stroke.
						</p>
						<p>
							&nbsp; Unemployment and the number of doctor's visits in the last year has a coefficient 0f 0.365.
							So contrary to the hypothesis that unemployment would lead to lower office visits (due to financial difficulty), 
							It seems that the jobless are going to the doctors more often than would be expected (due to medicare, govt programs, etc)
						</p>
						<p>
							&nbsp; In conclusion, there can be some generalizations to be drawn from our data exploration,
							but due to the lack of controlling variables or legitimate experimental control factors, we cannot say
							for certain that these generalities are valid across the population. However, this is a solid foundation
							to exploring relationships between the plotted data.
